Responsiveness
Gully Cric is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. The app supports both portrait and landscape modes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices.

Portrait Mode: In portrait mode, the app's layout is optimized for single-handed use, with intuitive navigation and easy-to-access buttons.
Landscape Mode: In landscape mode, the app utilizes the wider screen space to display more information and controls, enhancing the user experience during live scoring and match setup.
Example of Responsive Design
The app dynamically adjusts padding, font sizes, and layouts based on the device's orientation and screen size. For instance, in landscape mode, certain elements might be displayed in a more expanded view to take advantage of the available horizontal space.
